# **About Me**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
currently pursuing my master's degree in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My academic journey in statistics has provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis and quantitative reasoning. While I'm well-versed in statistical theories and applications, I'm currently venturing into the realm of web design for the first time. Navigating this new territory is both thrilling and challenging, and I'm excited to integrate my analytical background with web development.
